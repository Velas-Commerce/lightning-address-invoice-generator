# Lightning Address to BOLT11 Invoice Generator

These dead simple scripts allow you to generate a BOLT11 invoice from an Lightning Address.

There is a tutorial script that has a walk-through, lots of printouts and a general guide through how it all works.

There is also a simple invoice generator, which can be used to quickly pull invoices from any Lightning Address.

It asks for a Lightning Address and desired amount, and returns a BOLT11 invoice.
